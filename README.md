### Kia ora ðŸ‘‹

I'm a kiwi web developer, based in London who enjoys coding, people and travel! I love making great experiences, either with people using products I've help create, or creating code and documentation for a great developer experience.

I'm working full-time at Suade Labs, but in my spare time, I work on some OSS here. I als work on a product I've created called TrainFinder to help find cheap trains here in the UK - https://trainfinder.app
